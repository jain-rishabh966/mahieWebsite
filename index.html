      <h2>About this Idea</h2>
      <p>I wanted to give you the best birthday gift. This is not it. Far from it. But we have had a lot of time to just
        be silent on call with you while I am working. So what better way to wish you by me doing the same. This is
        probably my best skill and I will make full use of it.</p>
      <p>Our Journey in three phases till now: </p>

          <h3>Around the time we met</h3>
          <p>
            Well, our story is pretty eventful isn't it? When I first saw, I knew that you were a catch and you know
            what? After all this time I am even more sure of it than before. Just the difference is that I like you a
            lot more.

        <div class="col fade-in">
          <h3>You Becoming My Goto Person</h3>
          <p>
            Since the day we met, everything has changed. You became the person that made me happy by just being around
            me. We used to hangout a lot, drive like maniacs and frankly, go crazy all over the city. I miss that but
            that doesn't compare to what we have now.

        <div class="col fade-in">
          <h3>Finally! The amazing relationship we are in</h3>
          <p>
            I didn't realize when this happened and I am so sure it was the same with you. When we just went from being
            people who just are attracted to each other to actually start liking each other. Missing what the other
            person does is just something that happens now. It just is something unparallel and frankly, exactly what I
            know makes me really happy, especially because it's you!

          Our second meeting! After our fist meeing I really wanted to hang out with you.. Didn't know it would literally be the next day! As the both of us know, I've got no chill&#128541;! I wanted to meet you so I just came there. Street food and ice-cream was the perfect combination! I want to do that again soon! I miss hanging out (mostly eating &#128518;&#128523;) in Kamla Market with you soooo much.

          Obviously you like to spin! iSkate saw the best of you doing that. From meeing my school friends to becoming a
          noob and spinning around so often. It was an eventful but another day I didn't want to end! But maanna padega

          This was the first time the whole gang got together! We went from Ama to Kamla just to meet Jerry. It was fun, that scooty ride. Escaping the police people and you making it safer for me to ride.<br />
          Shruti scolded me protecting her best friend! Technically.. We were on a run from the police.. Don wali harkate you see? &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;

          Well.. Tacobell.. I have no idea what else to say. It is the only food we have had so many times that even the
          employees are going to recognize us soon. :p<br />
          But really! It was the best! Just not caring for any other food and just stuffing ourselves! Gosh it was fun
          fighting over the hard and the soft ones. PS burrito is the best!<br />
          It is just so much fun with you! I just cant begin to expain that it is just insane! Me, you and bengali have
          had our fair share of fun! I so wish we can do this again soon with our entire gang along with us. Just a
          giant party!
