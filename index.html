      <h2>About this Idea</h2>
      <p>I wanted to give you the best birthday gift. This is not it. Far from it. But we have had a lot of time to just
        be silent on call with you while I am working. So what better way to wish you by me doing the same. This is
        probably my best skill and I will make full use of it.</p>
      <p>Our Journey in three phases till now: </p>

          <h3>Around the time we met</h3>
          <p>
            Well, our story is pretty eventful isn't it? When I first saw, I knew that you were a catch and you know
            what? After all this time I am even more sure of it than before. Just the difference is that I like you a
            lot more.

        <div class="col fade-in">
          <h3>You Becoming My Goto Person</h3>
          <p>
            Since the day we met, everything has changed. You became the person that made me happy by just being around
            me. We used to hangout a lot, drive like maniacs and frankly, go crazy all over the city. I miss that but
            that doesn't compare to what we have now.

        <div class="col fade-in">
          <h3>Finally! The amazing relationship we are in</h3>
          <p>
            I didn't realize when this happened and I am so sure it was the same with you. When we just went from being
            people who just are attracted to each other to actually start liking each other. Missing what the other
            person does is just something that happens now. It just is something unparallel and frankly, exactly what I
            know makes me really happy, especially because it's you!

          The first day we met, Shruti had to do this... It was kind of nerve wracking as I didn't know how it would go but it surely was insane!
          Jim Beam, a silent 1st half and such second half? Saala chup nahi hui after daaru.. Meri chin ke gatak gai cz I have to drive..&#128557;&#128557;&#128557;
          Koin acha bahana maar leti yaar!!! Mast ghume the kaafi derr hum gaadi mei and kaafi baate ki.. Gosh I didn't know that day that this meeting would come this far 
          but since it has, its incredible! I just hope it stays this way always! Touchwood..

          Our second meeting! After our fist meeing I really wanted to hang out with you.. Didn't know it would literally be the next day! As the both of us know, I've got no chill&#128541;! I wanted to meet you so I just came there. Street food and ice-cream was the perfect combination! I want to do that again soon! I miss hanging out (mostly eating &#128518;&#128523;) in Kamla Market with you soooo much.

          Clearly, its for the world to see that I am the sporty one among the two of us.&#128540; Your bowling skills are outstanding!<br />
          Rest all aside, I am not sure what all we can do after this lockdown ends but we surely are going for a game of bowlinig and having a couple of beers doing so!<br/>

          Obviously you like to spin! iSkate saw the best of you doing that. From meeing my school friends to becoming a
          noob and spinning around so often. It was an eventful but another day I didn't want to end! But maanna padega

          This was the first time the whole gang got together! We went from Ama to Kamla just to meet Jerry. It was fun, that scooty ride. Escaping the police people and you making it safer for me to ride.<br />
          Shruti scolded me protecting her best friend! Technically.. We were on a run from the police.. Don wali harkate you see? &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;

          Well.. Tacobell.. I have no idea what else to say. It is the only food we have had so many times that even the
          employees are going to recognize us soon. :p<br />
          But really! It was the best! Just not caring for any other food and just stuffing ourselves! Gosh it was fun
          fighting over the hard and the soft ones. PS burrito is the best!<br />
          It is just so much fun with you! I just cant begin to expain that it is just insane! Me, you and bengali have
          had our fair share of fun! I so wish we can do this again soon with our entire gang along with us. Just a
          giant party!

          But seriously.. Fine wala day tha and meri phat gai thi! You taged along and we just had a lot of fun..<br />
          Uske baad kartikeya ko ghar se uthane ke liye kitta ghoome the hum. Nipun literaly said, "How did I still manage to reach before you guys" and it was hilarious!
          Hopefully the events of that day can be replicated and can come around soon! I would just love for that to happen taaki apan drive karte hue vapas masti kar pai..

          This is nothing overwhelming but just a memory that is very important to me.. Just for the simple fact that this day got me all hyped up about the fun element in you..
          We went to Kamla for just a little window shopping and putting on stuff.. You made me wear so much weird stuff (atleast tried to) but it was worth the fun we had...
          PS I will never wear that tiara thingy ever ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
